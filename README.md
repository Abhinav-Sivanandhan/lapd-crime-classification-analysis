# Checking the LAPD's crime classifications

The Times analyzed Los Angeles Police Department violent crime data from 2005 to 2012. Our analysis found that the Los Angeles Police Department misclassified an estimated 14,000 serious assaults as minor offenses, artificially lowering the cityâ€™s crime levels.

To conduct the analysis, The Times used an algorithm that combined two machine learning classifiers. [This is how we did it](https://github.com/datadesk/lapd-crime-classification-analysis/blob/master/classifiers.ipynb).
